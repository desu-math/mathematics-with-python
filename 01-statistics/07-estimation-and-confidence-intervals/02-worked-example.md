# Worked Examples: Confidence Intervals

Confidence intervals are constructed by combining three important components:

```text
Confidence Interval

=

Point Estimate

±

Margin of Error
```

where

```text
Margin of Error

=

Critical Value × Standard Error
```

The calculation method depends on whether the population standard deviation is known.

# Example 1: Z-Confidence Interval for the Population Mean

## Problem

A university wants to estimate the average mathematics score of its students.

A random sample of **64 students** is selected.

The sample has:

```text
Sample Mean (x̄) = 72

Population Standard Deviation (σ) = 8
```

Construct a **95% confidence interval** for the true population mean.

---

# Step 1: Identify the Information

Given:

```text
Sample size:

n = 64


Sample mean:

x̄ = 72


Population standard deviation:

σ = 8


Confidence level:

95%
```

Because the population standard deviation is known, we use the **Z-confidence interval**.

---

# Step 2: Determine the Critical Value

For a 95% confidence level,

```text
α = 1 - 0.95

α = 0.05
```

Since the interval is two-sided:

```text
α/2 = 0.025
```

The corresponding Standard Normal critical value is:

```text
Zα/2 = 1.96
```

---

# Step 3: Calculate the Standard Error

The standard error is

```text
        σ
SE = ------
       √n
```

Substitute the values:

```text
        8
SE = -------
       √64
```

Since

```text
√64 = 8
```

then

```text
SE = 8/8

SE = 1
```

Therefore,

```text
Standard Error = 1
```

---

# Step 4: Calculate the Margin of Error

The margin of error is

```text
ME = Zα/2 × SE
```

Substitute:

```text
ME = 1.96 × 1

ME = 1.96
```

---

# Step 5: Construct the Confidence Interval

The confidence interval is

```text
CI = x̄ ± ME
```

Substitute:

```text
CI = 72 ± 1.96
```

Lower limit:

```text
72 - 1.96 = 70.04
```

Upper limit:

```text
72 + 1.96 = 73.96
```

Therefore,

```text
95% Confidence Interval:

(70.04 , 73.96)
```

---

# Interpretation

We are 95% confident that the true average mathematics score of all university students lies between:

```text
70.04

and

73.96
```

# Example 2: t-Confidence Interval for the Population Mean

## Problem

A researcher wants to estimate the average daily study time of students.

A random sample of **25 students** is selected.

The sample results are:

```text
Sample Mean (x̄) = 6.5 hours

Sample Standard Deviation (s) = 2 hours
```

Construct a **95% confidence interval** for the population mean.

---

# Step 1: Identify the Information

Given:

```text
Sample size:

n = 25


Sample mean:

x̄ = 6.5


Sample standard deviation:

s = 2


Confidence level:

95%
```

The population standard deviation is unknown.

Therefore, we use the **t-confidence interval**.

---

# Step 2: Calculate Degrees of Freedom

For the t-distribution:

```text
Degrees of Freedom:

df = n - 1
```

Therefore:

```text
df = 25 - 1

df = 24
```

---

# Step 3: Determine the Critical Value

For:

```text
Confidence Level = 95%

Degrees of Freedom = 24
```

The t-critical value is approximately:

```text
tα/2,df = 2.064
```

---

# Step 4: Calculate the Standard Error

For the t-confidence interval:

```text
        s
SE = ------
       √n
```

Substitute:

```text
        2
SE = -------
       √25
```

Since

```text
√25 = 5
```

then

```text
SE = 2/5

SE = 0.4
```

Therefore,

```text
Standard Error = 0.4
```

---

# Step 5: Calculate the Margin of Error

The margin of error is

```text
ME = tα/2,df × SE
```

Substitute:

```text
ME = 2.064 × 0.4

ME = 0.8256
```

---

# Step 6: Construct the Confidence Interval

The confidence interval is

```text
CI = x̄ ± ME
```

Substitute:

```text
CI = 6.5 ± 0.8256
```

Lower limit:

```text
6.5 - 0.8256

= 5.6744
```

Upper limit:

```text
6.5 + 0.8256

= 7.3256
```

Therefore,

```text
95% Confidence Interval:

(5.67 , 7.33)
```

---

# Interpretation

We are 95% confident that the true average daily study time of all students lies between:

```text
5.67 hours

and

7.33 hours
```

---

# Comparing Z and t Confidence Intervals

The two methods follow the same general structure:

```text
Confidence Interval

=

Point Estimate

±

Critical Value × Standard Error
```

The difference is the distribution used.

| Situation                             | Method     | Critical Value |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------- | -------------- |
| Population standard deviation known   | Z-interval | Z value        |
| Population standard deviation unknown | t-interval | t value        |

---

# Important Observation

Notice that the t-confidence interval is usually wider than the Z-confidence interval.

Why?

Because the t-distribution includes additional uncertainty caused by estimating the population standard deviation.

As the sample size increases:

```text
t-distribution

↓

approaches

↓

Standard Normal distribution
```

Therefore, for large samples, Z and t confidence intervals become very similar.

---

# Final Summary

To construct any confidence interval:

1. Identify the population parameter.
2. Determine whether σ is known or unknown.
3. Choose Z or t distribution.
4. Find the critical value.
5. Calculate the standard error.
6. Calculate the margin of error.
7. Add and subtract the margin of error from the point estimate.
8. Interpret the interval in the context of the problem.
